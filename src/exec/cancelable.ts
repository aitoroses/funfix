 * `Cancelable` represents a one-time idempotent action that can be

 * focus, or to `IDisposable` in Microsoft .NET.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Scheduling execution with a 10 seconds delay
 * const ref = setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello1"), 10000)
 * const task = Cancelable.from(() => clearTimeout(ref))
 *
 * // If we change our mind
 * task.cancel()
 * ```
 *
 * In case some API requires the return of a `Cancelable` reference,
 * but there isn"t anything that can be canceled, then
 * [[Cancelable.empty]] can be used to return a reusable reference
 * that doesn"t do anything when canceled.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const task = Cancelable.empty()
 *
 * // It"s a no-op, doesn"t do anything
 * task.cancel()
