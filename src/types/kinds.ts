/**
 * Lightweight encoding for higher kinded types.
 *
 * Inspired by the
 * [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism]{@link https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf}
 * paper.
 *
 * Ã€ la carte imports work, assuming an ECMAScript 2015 compatible environment,
 * including ES2015 modules and `import` syntax:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { HK } from "funfix/dist/types/kinds"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { HK } from "funfix"
 * ```
 *
 * In absence of ES2015 compatibility, you can still rely on working with the
 * packaged (`pkg.main`) universal distribution that works within all browsers
 * and environments.
