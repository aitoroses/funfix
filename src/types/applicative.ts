 * import { Applicative } from "funfix/dist/types"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Applicative } from "funfix"

/**
 * `Applicative` functor type class.
 *
 * Allows application of a function in an Applicative context to a
 * value in an `Applicative` context.

 * - [Applicative programming with effects]{@link http://staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.pdf}
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * const F = applicativeOf(Option)
 *
 * F.ap(F.pure(1), F.pure((x: number) => x + 1)) // Some(2)
 * ```
 *
 * Note that having an `Applicative` instance implies that a
 * {@link Functor} implementation is also available, which is why
 * `Applicative` is a subtype of `Functor`.

 * CREDITS: this type class is inspired by the equivalent in Haskell's
 * standard library and the implementation is inspired by the
 * [Typelevel Cats]{@link http://typelevel.org/cats/} project.
