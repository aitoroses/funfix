/**
 * The `core` module exports basic types, data types and utilities that belong
 * in a standard library.
 *
 * Exports sub-modules:
 *
 * - [core/either](./core_either.html) for the {@link Either} data type
 * - [core/errors](./core_errors.html) for reusable error types
 * - [core/option](./core_option.html) for the {@link Option} data type
 * - [core/std](./core_std.html) for universal equality and hash code
 *   (e.g. {@link IEquals}, {@link is} and {@link hashCode})
 * - [core/try](./core_try.html) for the {@link Try} data type
 *
 * Ã€ la carte imports work, assuming an ECMAScript 2015 compatible environment,
 * including ES2015 modules and `import` syntax:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Option } from "funfix/dist/core"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Option } from "funfix"
 * ```
 *
 * In absence of ES2015 compatibility, you can still rely on working with the
 * packaged (`pkg.main`) universal distribution that works within all browsers
 * and environments.
