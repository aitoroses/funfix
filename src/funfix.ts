/**
 * The `funfix` root module.
 *
 * Exports sub-modules:
 *
 * - [core](./core.html) for basic types and utilities that belong in a standard library
 * - [exec](./exec.html) for low-level utilities, in support of everything else
 * - [effect](./effect.html) for dealing with side effects
 *
 * Ã€ la carte imports work, assuming an ECMAScript 2015 compatible environment,
 * including ES2015 modules and `import` syntax:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { Try } from "funfix/dist/core/try"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Try } from "funfix/dist/core"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Try } from "funfix/dist"
 * // ... or ...
 * import { Try } from "funfix"
 * ```
 *
 * In absence of ES2015 compatibility, you can still rely on working with the
 * packaged (`pkg.main`) universal distribution that works within all browsers
 * and environments.
 *
